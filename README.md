# Bogue tutorials

A collection of tutorials for the Bogue OCaml library.

---

[Bogue](http://sanette.github.io/bogue/Principles.html) is a GUI
library for developing desktop applications. The tutorials will guide
you from basic first steps to advanced methods.

The tutorials are best viewed online at this
[address](https://sanette.github.io/bogue-tutorials/bogue-tutorials/index.html).

You can also download the repository and open
`docs/bogue-tutorials/index.html` in a browser.

All tutorials come with automatically tested code, which can be
executed if you download the source and run `make exe` within a
tutorial directory. If you installed the `bogue-tutorials` opam
package, you may simply execute the `bogue-tutorials.xxx`
programs. (Replace `xxx` by the name of the tutorial.)

Of course, the code can also be manually copy-pasted in an OCaml
toplevel (REPL). See
[instructions here](https://sanette.github.io/bogue-tutorials/bogue-tutorials/index.html).

## WIP

This is work in progress: more tutorials will be added when time
permits.

On the other hand, the existing tutorials are fairly stable. At least,
they should work as expected.
