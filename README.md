# Bogue tutorials

A collection of tutorials for the Bogue OCaml library.

---

Bogue is a GUI library for developing desktop applications. The
tutorials will guide you from basic first steps to advanced methods.

The tutorials are best viewed online at this
[address](https://sanette.github.io/bogue-tutorials/bogue-tutorials/index.html).

All tutorials come with automatically tested code, which can be
executed if you download the source and execute `make exe` within a
tutorial directory.

Of course, the code can also be manually copy-pasted in an OCaml
toplevel (REPL). See
[instructions here](https://sanette.github.io/bogue-tutorials/bogue-tutorials/index.html).
