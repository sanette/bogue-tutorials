For instance, play a music when the user press the &quot;Play&quot; button. In order to do this, our Bogue app must wait until it detects a mouse click at the right place, and then run the action.</p><p>In Bogue, user interaction is done at the level of <b>Widgets</b>. For instance, one can use a Button widget to perform that task, namely using <a href="http://sanette.github.io/bogue/Bogue.Widget.html#VALbutton"><code>Widget.button</code></a> with the <code>~action</code> parameter.</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>open Bogue
module W = Widget
module L = Layout

let () =
  W.button ~action:(fun _ -&gt; print_endline &quot;Playing!&quot;) &quot;Play&quot;
  |&gt; L.resident ~w:100 ~h:30
  |&gt; Bogue.of_layout
  |&gt; Bogue.run</code></pre><p>In most cases, widgets don't act alone. For instance, a Slider widget can be connected to a Label widget in order to display on the Label the quantity selected by the user with the Slider. (Think of a &quot;volume&quot; slider for our audio player).</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let () =
  let label = W.label &quot;Volume:&quot; in
  let vol = W.label &quot;0    &quot; in
  let slider = W.slider_with_action ~action:(fun v -&gt;
      W.set_text vol (string_of_int v)) ~value:0 100 in
  L.flat ~align:Draw.Center
    [L.resident ~background:L.theme_bg slider;
     L.flat_of_w [label; vol]]
  |&gt; Bogue.of_layout
  |&gt; Bogue.run</code></pre><div class="figure"><img src="volume-slider.png" srcset="volume-slider.png 2x"></div><p>For this purpose, Bogue introduces the concept of <b>connections</b> between widgets.</p><p>Take a step back and try to visualize a whole, large GUI app. There are many widgets, distributed at arbitrary locations inside your window, and some of them are connected together, like the &quot;slider-label&quot; pair. Remember that specifying the location of widgets is done via <em>Layouts</em>, but the way widgets are connected may have nothing to do with the layout structure: our label may be at a very different place from our slider.</p><h2 id="the-widget-graph"><a href="#the-widget-graph" class="anchor"></a>The widget graph</h2><p>Here is a definition for our mathematician self: a (directed) graph, in the combinatoric sense, is a set of vertices together with a set of arrows; an arrow is a pair (e1,e2), where e1 and e2 are vertices. The presence of the pair (e1,e2) in the set of arrows of course means that e1 is connected to e2.</p><p>Thus, we see that the logic of a Bogue app is encoded in the <em>Widget graph</em>: vertices are widgets, and arrows are connections!</p><p>Connections are triggered by user interaction. In the case of <em>isolated</em> widgets, like the &quot;Play&quot; button above, we can view the action of playing the music as a connection from the widget to itself.</p><div class="figure"><img src="graph.png" srcset="graph.png 2x"></div><p>Saying that the <em>slider is connected to the label</em> means that the slider waits for user interaction, and reacts by performing an action which involves the label: for instance, change the number displayed by the label.</p><h2 id="why-connections?"><a href="#why-connections?" class="anchor"></a>Why connections?</h2><p>If you go back to our toy examples (the Play Button and the Volume Slider), you may wonder why we need to know about connections. These examples simply used an <code>action</code> parameter, which, in other GUI frameworks, is called a &quot;callback&quot;.</p><p>Under the hood, Bogue uses connections to perform this, but rather dumb ones: an action is merely a connection from a widget to itself. So why do we need arbitrary connections?</p><p>The problem with simple &quot;callbacks&quot; like these is that they prevent the construction of <em>cyclic connections</em>. Let's give a simple example: suppose that the user is also allowed to modify the volume by entering the number directly in the text field. Then, the slider should adjust itself to the new number, right?</p><p>The first change is to replace the <code>vol</code> label by a Text input widget. That's easy. But now comes the tricky part: we want to attach to the text input a new action which modifies the slider; but the slider was defined with an action parameter which modified the text input. Who is defined first?</p><p>This problem is impossible to solve using two <code>slider_with_action</code>. Instead, it's much easier to think in terms of connections. The graph is as follows: two widgets (nodes) and two connections in opposite directions (arrows <code>c1</code> and <code>c2</code>).</p><div class="figure"><img src="graph-volume.png" srcset="graph-volume.png 2x"></div><h2 id="creating-connections"><a href="#creating-connections" class="anchor"></a>Creating connections</h2><p>It's time to show how we define arbitrary connections in Bogue. The general function for this purpose is <a href="http://sanette.github.io/bogue/Bogue.Widget.html#VALconnect"><code>Widget.connect</code></a>. Its syntax is</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let c = W.connect source target action triggers</code></pre><p>This creates a connection <code>c</code> from <code>source</code> to <code>target</code>. Once attached to our Bogue app, this connection will execute the <code>action</code> as soon as the <code>triggers</code> events are detected.</p><p>The <code>action</code> function for connections is quite specific. It will be called with three arguments: <code>source target event</code>, where <code>event</code> is the specific event that triggered the action.</p><p>First, let us rewrite the previous &quot;Volume slider+label&quot; app using an explicit connection.</p><h3 id="triggers"><a href="#triggers" class="anchor"></a>Triggers</h3><p>Here is the usual list of events that a slider normally responds to. In recent Bogue versions (&gt;= 20240121), this can be obtained by the variable <code>Slider.triggers</code>.</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let slider_triggers =
  let open Trigger in
  List.flatten [buttons_down; buttons_up; pointer_motion; [Tsdl.Sdl.Event.key_down]]</code></pre><h3 id="action"><a href="#action" class="anchor"></a>Action</h3><p>Here is the action that will be used for our connection. Notice that it is a pure function, contrary to the action used in <code>slider_with_action</code> above, which had to access the closure (external variable) <code>vol</code>. We don't care about which specific event triggered the action, hence the variable <code>_ev</code> is not used.</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let update_text src dst _ev =
  let v = Slider.value (W.get_slider src) in
  W.set_text dst (string_of_int v)</code></pre><h3 id="the-connected-volume-slider-(one-way)"><a href="#the-connected-volume-slider-(one-way)" class="anchor"></a>The connected Volume slider (one way)</h3><p>And here is the Bogue app. Notice the <code>~connections:[c]</code> argument when constructing our board.</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let () =
  let label = W.label &quot;Volume:&quot; in

  |&gt; Bogue.run</code></pre><p><b>Note:</b> By default, actions run by <code>connect</code> are launched in a new thread, so that even a slow action will not make the GUI unresponsive. Here, we know that our action is very fast, so launching a new thread for every slider motion would be overkill. That's why we use <code>W.connect_main</code> (which is an alias for <code>W.connect ~priority:W.Main</code>) to tell Bogue it should run the action in the main thread.</p><h3 id="the-two-way-connected-volume-slider"><a href="#the-two-way-connected-volume-slider" class="anchor"></a>The two-way connected Volume slider</h3><p>Finally, as promised above, let's use connections to obtain a bi-directional connection between a Volume slider and a Text input.</p><p>We define the list of events that should trigger the connection from the Text_input side, and the action to perform.</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let text_triggers = Tsdl.Sdl.Event.[text_editing; text_input; key_down; key_up]

Imagine a checker game with the following rules. Coins have a black face and a white face (like in the Reversi/Othello game). Each player in turn place their color in any available square on the board. Then any coin positioned immediately on the left, right, top or bottom of that coin must be flipped to change its color. When the board is full, the player with more coins of their color on the board wins.</p><div class="figure"><img src="reversi.jpg" srcset="reversi.jpg 2x"></div><h3 id="connection-graph"><a href="#connection-graph" class="anchor"></a>Connection graph</h3><p>Can we code the whole game using connections? Yes, indeed: each square is a widget, and we connect it with the 4 neighboring squares: left, up, right, down, in order to check whether we need to flip a coin. We also connect it with itself, to change its status from empty to black or white, when the user clicks on it. That's it!</p><p><div class="figure"><img src="checkers-4.png" srcset="checkers-4.png 2x"></div> The connection graph for a 4 x 4 board.</p><h3 id="box-widgets"><a href="#box-widgets" class="anchor"></a>Box Widgets</h3><p>Let's code this! We will use a simple Box widget for each square. We need 3 different states: empty, black, white. In order to draw a colored disc (the coin), a simple rounded background with radius <code>w/2</code> will do the trick.</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>type state = Empty | Black | White

But we don't have any graphics yet, because we didn't define any layout. Let's do this now. Each Box will belong to a layout, and then we group the layouts into a square board. To make it more fancy, let us alternate the background color of the small layout in order to obtain a nice checkerboard.</p><pre class="language-ocaml"><code>let dark = Style.(of_bg (opaque_bg Draw.(find_color &quot;saddlebrown&quot;)))
