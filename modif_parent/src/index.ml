   {1 How to execute this tutorial}

   You may simply open an [OCaml] toplevel (for instance [utop]), and load
   [Bogue]:

   {[
     #thread;;
     #require "bogue";;
   ]}

   Of course we assume that you have a working
   {{:https://ocaml.org/docs/up-and-running}OCaml} environment and installed the
   {{:https://github.com/sanette/bogue}bogue} library.

   Then, you can simply follow the {{!page-modif_parent}tutorial} by pasting the
   code chunks into the toplevel.

   Another option is to execute at once the whole tutorial with the command:
   [make exe].

   {1 Ready?}

   Then  {{!page-modif_parent}let's start}.
